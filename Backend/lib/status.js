    lib/status.js   (backend/lib/, next to slots.js)

    The shared appointments table stores statuses in capitals
    (CONFIRMED, CHECKED_IN, CANCELLED ...). The AMS pages use Booked,
    Rescheduled, Completed, Cancelled and No-show. This file is the one
    place that translates between the two. Check the values your table
    really uses with:

        SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM appointments GROUP BY status;
        SELECT conname, pg_get_constraintdef(oid) FROM pg_constraint
        WHERE conrelid = 'appointments'::regclass AND contype = 'c';

    and change DB_STATUS below if a name differs (RESCHEDULED, COMPLETED
    and NO_SHOW are guesses; CONFIRMED, CHECKED_IN and CANCELLED come from
    the existing rows).
