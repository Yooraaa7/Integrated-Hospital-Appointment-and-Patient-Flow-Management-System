/*
    routes/dashboard.js  ->  GET /api/dashboard/summary

    Returns what Dashboard.js (HospitalAnalytics.html) draws:

        todaysAppointments, upcomingNext7Days, cancellationsToday,
        doctorsOnDuty, doctorsTotal,
        todaysSchedule[], doctorAvailability[], needsAttention[],
        appointmentsByDepartment[], bookedVsCancelledLast7Days[]

    "Today" and "this week" are Asia/Kuala_Lumpur days. Appointments are
    counted on the day they are scheduled for. Statuses are translated by
    lib/status.js (CONFIRMED -> Booked and so on).

    Needs schedule_tables.sql (doctor_consultation_hours and
    doctor_unavailability) to have been run.
